    <h3>
      Baahubali 2 was one of the most anticipated films of 2017, primarily due
      to the massive cliffhanger ending of its predecessor.[11][12] The film
      premiered on over 9,000 screens worldwide, with 6,500 screens in India,
      setting a record for the widest release of an Indian film.[13][14] Upon
      its release, Baahubali 2 like its predecessor, received widespread acclaim
      for its direction, storytelling, cinematography, themes, visual effects,
      music, action sequences, and performances.[15] The film grossed over
      ₹1810.60 crore worldwide, briefly becoming the highest grossing Indian
      film of all time, surpassing PK (2014). It collected approximately ₹792
      crore worldwide within the first six days and became the first Indian film
      to gross over ₹1,000 crore. Within India, it set numerous records,
      becoming the highest-grossing film in Hindi, as well as in its original
      Telugu language. As of 2025, Baahubali 2 remains the highest-grossing film
      in India. It is currently the highest grossing Telugu film, the highest
      grossing South Indian film, and the second highest-grossing Indian film
      worldwide.
